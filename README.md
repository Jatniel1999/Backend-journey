# Backend Journey

This repository documents my step-by-step path to becoming a backend engineer.
It includes daily coding exercises, notes, and projects as I build my skills
in JavaScript and backend development.

---

## Week 1 – JavaScript Foundations

### Day 2 – JavaScript Functions
**Topics covered:**
- Creating and calling functions
- Function parameters and arguments
- Return values
- Variable scope (local vs global)
- Understanding how JavaScript resolves variables using the closest scope

**Why this matters:**
Functions are the foundation of backend development. API routes, business logic,
authentication, validation, and database interactions are all built using
functions.
